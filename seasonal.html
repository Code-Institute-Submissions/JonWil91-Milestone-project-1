                    <p class="season-section">To anyone who is thinking about a working visa in Canada, heading to a ski hill to work or hit the slopes is a must! Within two weeks of arriving in Canada, I was living on a ski hill, <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/" target="_blank">SilverStar Mountain</a>                        in British Columbia for the next 5 months. It instantly put me in a position to meet countless people who were in the exact same situation as me; far from home, didn't know anyone and wanting to have a good time. You get to meet
                        people from all over the world as you learn all the exicitings things about ski hill life together. If you've never skiied or snowboarded before that's no problem as chances are, you are going to be living with some people who
                        have never seen snow before! I'd personally never snowboarded before so thought a winter season was the best time, there's still room for improvement but I'm not totally useless now! The staff accommodation was a great experience
                        as I made friends quickly, since you are all sleeping and eating in the same place, and all working on the same hill. You quickly get to recognise most people on the hill both in normal clothes and wrapped up in their ski gear!
                        There are a variety of jobs you would be able to do while working on a ski hill that give you plenty of time to hits the slopes or hang out with friends in your free time. If this is something you'd want to do, just be prepared
                        that it can get as cold as -30 degrees Celius and beyond! One slightly less exciting thing to note about a winter season is the necessary insurance but that will be covered in more detail in the <a href="info.html">Info</a> section.

                    <p class="season-section">If you're not a fan of the snow and the cold then you will love summer in Canada. It's difficult to know where to go in Canada as when the sun comes out there is so many beauitful, postcard picture landscapes around. Whilst Canada
                        is a huge country with a lot to see it is possible to get around with greyhound bus when you need, or flying when you feel it's just too far. Out towards the East you have the exciting city of Toronto, amazing views at Niagara
                        Falls, as well as French-Canadian Quebec to explore. If mountains and lakes are more your thing, you could spend an incredible Summer in the Canadian Rockies, in places like Banff or Jasper. I spent a summer there and everyday
                        the views would never got old. The main thing to be aware of when out hiking is the wildlife and how to be prepared, more on this below. Heading further across the country to the West you could spend a summer in bustling Vancouver
                        which is a good location for seeing some amazing mountains and beaches. Further across still is Vancouver Island which has a nice chilled out feeling, and is host to activities such as whale watching in the right season, long hikes
                        along the coast and well known for attracting the surf crowd to Tofino. You're not really going to go wrong wherever you spend your summer in Canada, you just want to put a bit of research in to decide what sort places you'd like
                        to see and what you'd like to do.

                            <p>One thing you will learn quickly once you arrive in Canada is that there is a lot of delicious food. A staple snack/meal in Canada is the poutine, this is chips, gravy and melted cheese curds. It may not sound like much but
                                when you've tried the variations of the dish around the country you'll wonder how you lived without it.
