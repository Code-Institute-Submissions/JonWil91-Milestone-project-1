It's difficult to know where to go in Canada as when the sun comes out there is so many beauitful, postcard picture landscapes around.

Heading further across the country to the West you could spend a summer in bustling Vancouver which is a good location for seeing","                some amazing mountains and beaches. Further across still is Vancouver Island which has a nice chilled out feeling, and is host to activities such as whale watching in the right season, long hikes along the coast and well known for attracting","                the surf crowd to Tofino. You're not really going to go wrong wherever you spend your summer in Canada, you just want to put a bit of research in to decide what sort places you'd like to see and what you'd like to do.","
