heading to a ski hill to work or hit the slopes is a must! Within two weeks of arriving in Canada, I was living on a ski hill, <a href=\"https://www.skisilverstar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SilverStar Mountain</a>                in British Columbia for the next 5 months. It instantly put me in a position to meet countless people who were in the exact same situation as me; far from home, didn't know anyone and wanting to have a good time. You get to meet people","                from all over the world as you learn all the exicitings things about ski hill life together. If you've never skiied or snowboarded before that's no problem as chances are, you are going to be living with some people who have never seen","                snow before! I'd personally never snowboarded before so thought a winter season was the best time, there's still room for improvement but I'm not totally useless now! The staff accommodation was a great experience as I made friends quickly,","                since you are all sleeping and eating in the same place, and all working on the same hill. You quickly get to recognise most people on the hill both in normal clothes and wrapped up in their ski gear! There are a variety of jobs you would","                be able to do while working on a ski hill that give you plenty of time to hits the slopes or hang out with friends in your free time. If this is something you'd want to do, just be prepared that it can get as cold as -30 degrees Celius","                and beyond! One slightly less exciting thing to note about a winter season is the necessary insurance but that will be covered in more detail in the <a href=\"info.html\">Info</a> section.","            </p>","
