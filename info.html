                            <h4>Starting the exciting process</h4>
                            <p>The first step is to head to your countries <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/entry-requirements" target="_blank">Government Website,</a></p> search for working holiday visas and investigate what forms you
                            need to read and fill in for your choice of country. There will be a lot of paperwork with this application but it is worth it!

                            <h4>Working hoiday companies</h4>
                            <p>This is an optional next step as it is not essential but it can definitely help people who have never done anything like this before, hence the reason I used
                                <a href="https://www.theworkingholidayclub.com/canada/" target="_blank">The Working Holiday Club</a>. These companies can help arrange the all important first job for when you arrive in Canada, as well as providing support
                                and encouragement along the way, and in some cases they can also assist in the visa application process.</p>

                            <h4>Insurance</h4>
                            <p>Insurance is arguably one of the most important things to think about before thinking about working and living abroad, especially in a winter season where the risk of injury is significantly higher. One thing to be aware of
                                is that even if you're insured the hospital may insist on at least the doctors fee for admission, as long as you paperwork to record thing you can add it to your claim. I personally used <a href="https://www.travelcounsellors.co.uk/gb/leisure"
                                    target="_blank">Travel Counsellors</a>. There may be better ones out there but this is the company I went with and I was looked after.</p>

                            <h4>Country and culture</h4>
                            <p>One of the first things you are going to learn once you arrive in Canada is that, like America, tipping is part of their culture. If you want to integrate yourself properly into a new country you need to be aware of these little
                                details. Standard practice is to tip $15.00 for good service (this is an expected addition to the bill) or $20.00 for great service. At the bar, if you're paying by the round, you want to be adding a $1.00 per drink at
                                least. You want the barman of all people to be your friend!</p>
